/// ShadowLend Arcium Circuits (encrypted-ixs)
///
/// These circuits run inside Arcium MXE for confidential computation.
/// Each circuit operates on encrypted user state and returns encrypted results.
///
/// Key Design Decisions:
/// - Use Enc<Shared, T> for user-decryptable data (user can decrypt with private key)
/// - Use Enc<Mxe, T> for protocol-only data (pool state, internal computations)
/// - Fixed-size structs only (no Vec<T>)
/// - Use .min() / .max() for saturating arithmetic (safe for MPC)
/// - Boolean flags inside output structs (decrypted in callback)
///
/// CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION DESIGN:
/// - Pool state is encrypted with Enc<Mxe, PoolState> - only protocol can decrypt
/// - User state is encrypted with Enc<Shared, UserState> - user can decrypt
/// - Outputs only reveal success/failure via struct bool fields
